# NeuronalFeatureSpace

This is subproject of defining joint feature space for mouse CNS E12-E14, more specifically from E12R1, E14Di, E14vMB and E14R1 non-multimodal scATAC processed samples.

Open topics include how to validate clades biologically, or is this necessary as such. However, some type of optimization for cut height needs to be done.
